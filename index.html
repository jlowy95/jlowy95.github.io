    <h5>Climber // Photographer // Data Scientist To-Be</h6>
    <p style="max-width: 450px">
        Climbing photography has been a growing passion and hobby of mine since I started college.  My original focus was to give friends who were new to the sport something that captured the thrill and power of climbing, something to share with their family and friends.  Since then my focus has broadened to capturing the beauty of where and what we climb, to inspire more people to step outside of their homes and their comfort zones, and to catalog my personal adventures.
        Always looking for adventure and people to share in it.
